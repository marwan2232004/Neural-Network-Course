  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "1. Implement the `guessing_game` function which takes two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max`: The maximum value for the range of random numbers.\n",
    "- `attempts`: The maximum number of attempts to guess the number. This should be a keyword-only argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The function should generate a random number between `1` and `max` (inclusive) and ask the user to guess a number in that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After receiving the user guess, the function should provide feedback if the guess is `too low`, `too high`, or `correct` and the number of `attempts` left.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Note that you should use `try-except` so if the user provides an input that Python can't explictly convert into an integer, then a meaningful exception should be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The function should continue prompting the user for guesses until they guess the correct number or run out of attempts and print a relevent message.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The function should return `True` if the user guesses the correct number within the allowed attempts, and `False` otherwise. In both cases, it should also return a tuple `guesses` listing the guesses by the users and an integer `chosen_int` for the correct guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Additionally, implement a `play_game()` function that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calls `guessing_game(max, attempts)` with a maximum value of `20` and `5` attempts.\n",
    "- If the player has lost\n",
    "    - It asserts that the tuple `guesses` did not have the number `chosen_int`, printing an error if the assertion fails, and asks them if they want to play again where the program repeats if they answer `yes`. \n",
    "- If the player has won\n",
    "    - It asserts that `chosen_int` is indeed in guesses, printing an error if the assertion fails, and ends the program\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Both functions and variables therein should be type-annotated and optionally documented\n",
    "\n",
    "If it helps, you can define additional functions and call them within the two mentioned above for better organization."
